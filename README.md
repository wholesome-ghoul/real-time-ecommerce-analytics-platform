# Project description

Build a real-time analytics platform for an e-commerce website. This platform
will help businesses monitor and analyze their e-commerce data, including user
behavior, product performance, and sales trends. It will consist of multiple
microservices, each serving a specific purpose, and leverage the mentioned
technologies.

## Key Components and Technologies:

1. _Microservices Architecture_: Break down the application into microservices,
   such as user authentication, product catalog, order management, analytics,
   and recommendation engine.
2. _Docker Containers_: Containerize each microservice using Docker to ensure
   consistency and portability across environments.
3. _Kubernetes (K8s)_: Deploy and manage the microservices on a Kubernetes
   cluster for scalability, load balancing, and automated scaling based on
   demand.
4. _PostgreSQL Database_: Use PostgreSQL as the database system for storing
   transactional and analytical data. Implement data partitioning and indexing
   strategies for performance optimization.
5. _Real-time Data Streaming_: Implement real-time data streaming using
   technologies like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to capture user events, such as
   page views, clicks, and purchases.
6. _Data Processing and Analysis_: Develop microservices in Golang and Node.js
   for real-time data processing and analytics. Use technologies like Apache
   Flink or Spark Streaming for complex event processing.
7. _Dashboard and Visualization_: Create a web-based dashboard using Node.js
   and a front-end framework (e.g., React or Vue.js) to display real-time
   analytics, charts, and insights.
8. _Data Warehousing_: Implement a data warehousing solution (e.g., Amazon
   Redshift, Google BigQuery) for long-term storage and historical analysis of
   e-commerce data.
9. _Security_: Implement security measures like OAuth2 for authentication, TLS
   for data encryption, and role-based access control (RBAC) for data
   protection.
10. _Monitoring and Scaling_: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for
    monitoring the health and performance of microservices. Implement automatic
    scaling policies based on resource utilization.
11. _System Design_: Pay close attention to system design principles, including
    data modeling, API design, and fault tolerance.

## Benefits and Learning Outcomes:

- Gain hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Learn how to build microservices in Golang and Node.js.
- Understand data-intensive application architecture, including real-time data streaming and processing.
- Master PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
- Practice system design and scalability principles for robust, high-performance applications.
- Create a real-world project that demonstrates your skills to potential employers or clients.
